                <p id="bio-text">Albert Einstein was a theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one
                    of
                    the two pillars of modern physics. Born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Germany, Einstein's work is also
                    known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He is best known for his mass-energy
                    equivalence
                    formula \(E = mc^2\), which has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation."</p>

            Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect, a pivotal step in the evolution of quantum theory. His intellectual achievements and originality have made the word "Einstein" synonymous with genius.
            <br><br>
            Beyond his scientific contributions, Einstein was a passionate advocate for civil rights, education, and world peace. He was a vocal critic of nationalism and authoritarianism, and his humanitarian efforts earned him global admiration.
            <br><br>
            Einstein's legacy continues to inspire scientists, philosophers, and thinkers worldwide. His theories have shaped our understanding of the universe and remain foundational to modern physics.
